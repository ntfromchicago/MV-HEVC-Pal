THIS IS A BETA BUILT WITH Xcode 26 beta + tested on macOS 26 beta. You have been warned.

It says it runs on Intel but the commands it uses do not. Sorry to everyone with an older Mac.

MV-HEVC Pal is a utility that takes SBS 3D videos and converts them into MV-HEVC files for use on Apple Vision Pro.

Special thanks and full credit goes to Mike Swanson for the spatial video tools that must be installed for MV-HEVC Pal to work.

Download the .zip file to try it out. I'll be working on this until macOS goes live in production.
